In order to run our program, you need to use StdIn to load up a song that you want to play.
example: java-introcs Game < waiting_for_love.txt

In the StdIn txt file, there should be a character, followed by the number of notes associated with that character, followed by the time stamps of every note associated with that character. Repeat this for all 8 keys.

example:
a
5
0.24
0.48
0.91
1.12
1.34
1.58
b
3
0.89
1.04
1.59
...

For the output, there should be a StdDraw window that pops up with our game. The notes should start falling down from the top of the screen based on the rhythm of the song you are playing, which should also be playing in the background.
